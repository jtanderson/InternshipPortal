## 425: Internship Portal Project
Goal: Discuss the current state of the project and answer questions
Attendees: Dr. Anderson, Blaine Mason, Jacob Duncan, Justin Ventura, Margaret Finnegan

### Actions: 
Discussed sqlalchemy and postgresql
The contact form sends an email to admin
Need two separate contact forms, student and business
When the business uploads the form the admin can approve on the dashboard
The admin dashboard needs, pending, current and previous internships access
In the database, there may need to be a companies table instead of a column

### Takeaways: 

Create the ER diagram
Work on admin dashboard and admin pages

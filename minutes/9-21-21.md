## 425: Internship Portal Project Minutes 9-21-21

Goal: Discuss details about database management
Attendees: Dr. Anderson, Blaine Mason, Jacob Duncan, Justin Ventura, Margaret Finnegan

### Actions:

Dr. Anderson approved of current pull requests.
Discussed Migration of tables and how it works in our implementations
Tools given:
FlaskDB
Alembic

### Note:

Each tester needs to have their own instance of a PosgreSQL database named "internship_database".
Also, a .env will need to be generated so user details can exist for the connection of the database and sessions.
Admin dashboard needs to exist to add functionality like accept, delete, and view listings for the database.

### Takeaways:

PostgreSQL servers need to be setup on each machine and .env files made.
